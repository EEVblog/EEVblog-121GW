## SETUP

Be sure to install the Plugin.BluetoothLE nuget package in all of your main platform projects as well as your core/PCL project

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Plugin.BluetoothLE.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Plugin.BluetoothLE/)

**Android**

Add the following to your AndroidManifest.xml

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"/>

<!--this is necessary for Android v6+ to get the device name and address-->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

**iOS**

If you want to use background BLE periperhals, add the following to your Info.plist

```xml
<!--for connecting to devices (client)-->
<array>
    <string>bluetooth-central</string>
</array>

<!--for server configurations-->
<array>
    <string>bluetooth-peripheral</string>
</array>

<!--To add a description to the Bluetooth request message (on iOS 10 this is required!)-->

<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>YOUR CUSTOM MESSAGE</string>
```

## HOW TO USE - CLIENT BASICS

```csharp

// discover some devices
CrossBleAdapter.Current.Scan().Subscribe(scanResult => {});

// Once finding the device/scanresult you want
await scanResult.Device.Connect();

Device.WhenAnyCharacteristicDiscovered().Subscribe(characteristic => {
    // read, write, or subscribe to notifications here
    var result = await characteristic.Read(); // use result.Data to see response
    await characteristic.Write(bytes);

    characteristic.SubscribeToNotifications(result => {
    	//result.Data to get at response
    });
});

```


## HOW TO USE - SERVER BASICS

Most important things - you should setup all of your services and characteristics BEFORE you Start() the server!

```csharp
var server = CrossBleAdapter.Current.CreateGattServer();
var service = server.AddService(Guid.NewGuid(), true);

var characteristic = service.AddCharacteristic(
    Guid.NewGuid(),
    CharacteristicProperties.Read | CharacteristicProperties.Write | CharacteristicProperties.WriteWithoutResponse,
    GattPermissions.Read | GattPermissions.Write
);

var notifyCharacteristic = service.AddCharacteristic
(
    Guid.NewGuid(),
    CharacteristicProperties.Indicate | CharacteristicProperties.Notify,
    GattPermissions.Read | GattPermissions.Write
);

IDisposable notifyBroadcast = null;
notifyCharacteristic.WhenDeviceSubscriptionChanged().Subscribe(e =>
{
    var @event = e.IsSubscribed ? "Subscribed" : "Unsubcribed";

    if (notifyBroadcast == null)
    {
        this.notifyBroadcast = Observable
            .Interval(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1))
            .Where(x => notifyCharacteristic.SubscribedDevices.Count > 0)
            .Subscribe(_ =>
            {
                Debug.WriteLine("Sending Broadcast");
                var dt = DateTime.Now.ToString("g");
                var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(dt);
                notifyCharacteristic.Broadcast(bytes);
            });
    }
});

characteristic.WhenReadReceived().Subscribe(x =>
{
    var write = "HELLO";

    // you must set a reply value
    x.Value = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(write);

    x.Status = GattStatus.Success; // you can optionally set a status, but it defaults to Success
});
characteristic.WhenWriteReceived().Subscribe(x =>
{
    var write = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(x.Value, 0, x.Value.Length);
    // do something value
});

await server.Start(new AdvertisementData
{
    LocalName = "TestServer"
});
```

## FAQ

Q. Why is everything reactive instead of events/async

> I wanted event streams as I was scanning devices.  I also wanted to throttle things like characteristic notification feeds.  Lastly, was the proper cleanup of events and resources.

Q. Why are Device.Connect, Characteristic.Read, and Descriptor.Read observable when async would do just fine?

> True, but observables with RX are actually awaitable as well and far easier to chain into other things.

Q. Why are devices cleared on a new scan?

> Some platforms yield a "new" device and therefore new hooks.  This was observed on some android devices.

Q. My characteristic read/writes/notifications are not working

> If you store your discovered characteristics in your own variables, make sure to refresh them with each (re)connect

Q. I cannot see the device name in Android 6+

> You need to enable permissions for android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION 

Q. I cannot see the device name when scanning in the background on iOS

> This is the work of iOS.  The library cannot fix this.  You should scan by service UUIDs instead

Q. Does this support Bluetooth v2?

> No - please read about bluetooth specifications before using this library.  LE (Low Energy) is part of the v4.0 specification.

Q. Why can't I disconnect devices selectively in the GATT server?

> On android, you can, but exposing this functionality in xplat proves challenging since iOS does not support A LOT of things


Q. Why can't I configure the device name on Android?

> Please read the [advertising docs](docs/server_advertising.md) on this
