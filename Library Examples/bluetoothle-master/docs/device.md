# Device

This section deals with gatt connections and state monitoring for a device.
You should maintain a reference to a device if you intend to connect to it.


**Connect/Disconnect to a device**

```csharp
// connect
await device.Connect(new GattConnectionConfig 
{
        /// <summary>
        /// This will cause disconnected devices to try to immediately reconnect.  It will cause WillRestoreState to fire on iOS. Defaults to true
        /// </summary>
        public bool IsPersistent { get;  set; } = true;

        /// <summary>
        /// Android only - If you have characteristics where you need faster replies, you can set this to high
        /// </summary>
        public ConnectionPriority Priority { get; set; } = ConnectionPriority.Normal;

        /// <summary>
        /// iOS only
        /// </summary>
        public bool NotifyOnConnect { get; set; }

        /// <summary>
        /// iOS/tvOS/macOS only
        /// </summary>
        public bool NotifyOnDisconnect { get; set; }

        /// <summary>
        /// iOS only
        /// </summary>
        public bool NotifyOnNotification { get; set; }    
});

// this will disconnect a current connection, cancel a connection attempt, and
// remove persistent connections
device.CancelConnection();
```

**Reliable Write Transactions**

_Android and UWP only_

```csharp
using (var trans = device.BeginReliableWriteTransaction()) 
{
    await trans.Write(theCharacteristicToWriteTo, bytes);
    // you should do multiple writes here as that is the reason for this mechanism
    trans.Commit();
}
```


**Pairing with a device**
```csharp
if (device.IsPairingRequestSupported && device.PairingStatus != PairingStatus.Paired) 
{
    // there is an optional argument to pass a PIN in PairRequest as well
    device.PairRequest().Subscribe(isSuccessful => {});
}
```

**Request MTU size increase**


**MTU (Max Transmission Unit)**
If MTU requests are available (Android Only - API 21+)

This is specific to Android only where this negotiation is not automatic.
The size can be up to 512, but you should be careful with anything above 255 in practice
```csharp
// Request a greater MTU size (Androd API 21+ only), but return the final negotiated value
var newMtuValue = await device.RequestMtu(255);

// iOS will return current, Android will return 20 unless changes are observed
device.GetCurrentMtu();

// iOS will return current value and return, Android will continue to monitor changes
device.WhenMtuChanged().Subscribe(...)
```

**Monitor device states**

```csharp
// This will tell you if the device name changes during a connection
device.WhenNameChanged().Subscribe(string => {});

// this will monitor the RSSI of the connected device.  This will attempt to pull the RSSI every 3 seconds by default
device.WhenRssiChanged().Subscribe(rssi => {});

// this will watch the connection states to the device
device.WhenStatusChanged().Subscribe(connectionState => {});

// monitor MTU size changes (droid only)
device.WhenMtuChanged().Subscribe(size => {});

```
