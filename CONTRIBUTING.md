Hello!!!

Adhere, like glue to these rules:

1. Don't be a jerk.
2. Understand it as a work in progress.
3. Keep messages succinct.
4. Runtime issues need examples.
5. Don't be offended if changes are rejected, sometimes they will be even when they are great, that is usually because a future change would conflict.

This is a very simple contributing guide, YAY.
